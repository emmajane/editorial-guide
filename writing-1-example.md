This page is an example of how you can create new pages in this guide. To ensure that your pages are prepared correctly, you should use _Front Matter_ section, featured at the top the source file for this page, `writing-1-example.md`.

You can write using [GitHub-flavoured Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax. It is really easy to get in to and makes editing much quicker than using a WYSIWYG editor or plain HTML markup.
