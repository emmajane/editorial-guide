**Artwork** Matter other than text prepared for reproduction, such as illustrations, figures and photos

**Bitmap** A representation, consisting of rows and columns of dots, of a graphics image in computer memory. The value of each dot (whether it is filled in or not) is stored in one or more bits of data. For simple monochrome images, one bit is sufficient to represent each dot, but for colours and shades of grey, each dot requires more than one bit of data 

**Blueprint** Final photographic proof made from films before printing 

**Blurb** Short (no more than 200 words) description of a book or periodical, usually on the back cover, used for promotional purposes 

**Cataloguing in publication (CIP) data** Prepublication cataloguing records for widely distributed books (usually on copyright page of advocacy information products) 

**Character** Letter, numeral, symbol in text 

**Cromalin** Trade name for a four-colour proof made from colour separations; used to check colour and register before printing 

**CMYK** Cyan, magenta, yellow and black - the **subtractive** primary colours (plus black) commonly used on a printing press for full-colour reproduction. These colours are deposited as dots of different sizes, shapes and angles to create the illusion of different colours on print 

**Colour separation** The conversion of the red, green, and blue colour information used by a computer into the cyan, magenta, yellow and black channels that are used to make printing plates 

**DPI** Dots per inch - a measurement of output resolution for printers and imagesetters 

**Emblem** Symbol consisting of a combination of words, letters and designs, identifying an organization or programme/project. In addition to being an identifier, an emblem is also a sign of endorsement or approval (see also Logotype) 

**Encapsulated Postscript (EPS)** A standard file format commonly used for graphics material that is to be inserted into desktop publishing files. It is based on the **PostScript** page description language used by printers and imagesetters. It allows vector artwork to be stored an resized irrespective of resolution. EPS files usually include a low-resolution preview. Suffix .eps 

**Folio** Page number 

**Font** A design for a set of characters combined with properties such as size, pitch, and spacing. Within each font, other variations, such as sizes, italic, bold, etc., can also be made 

**Four-colour process** Depositing combinations of the **subtractive** primaries cyan, magenta, yellow and black on paper. These colourants are deposited as dots of different sizes, shapes and angles to create the illusion of different colours 

**FTP** File Transfer Protocol - a method for transferring files over the Internet 

**Gutter** The two inner margins of facing pages of a book 

**Halftone** Process whereby a continuous-tone image, such as a photograph, is broken up into a pattern of dots of various size before printing. Reproductions of photos in printed matter are called halftones 

**HTML** Hypertext Markup Language 

**Imagesetter** High-resolution device that prints the films (one for each colour separation) used to create plates for the printing press 

**Imprint** Name of the publisher with place and date of printing 

**JPEG** Established by a committee known as the Joint Photographic Experts Group, JPEG is the first international compression standard for continuous-tone still colour images (JPEG). Although it can reduce files to about 5 percent of their normal size, considerable detail is lost when high compression is used. Lower compression rates can give good results but result in larger files. Suffix .jpg/.jpe/.jpeg 

**Justification** Spacing of words and characters to a specified line measure so that both margins are aligned 

**Kerning** Adjustment of space between characters to avoid excessive separation 

**Leading** Spacing between lines 

**Line art** Any image that is composed of lines and text, e.g. graphs, charts and illustrations. Best saved in vector formats (EPS) 

**Logotype ("logo")** Symbol consisting of a combination of words, letters and designs, identifying an organization or programme/project (see also **Emblem**) 

**Offprint** Reprint of an article, or other part of a publication, produced as a separate unit 

**Orphan** Short paragraph-ending line (often one word) appearing at the bottom of a page or column; to be avoided (see also **Widow**)

**Pantone** (PMS - Pantone Matching System) An international standard for matching colour printing inks 

**PDF** Portable Document Format, a file format developed by Adobe Systems. PDF captures formatting information from a variety of desktop publishing applications, making it possible to send formatted documents and have them appear on the recipient's monitor or printer as they were intended. To view a file in PDF format, it is necessary to have Adobe Acrobat Reader, a free application distributed by Adobe Systems. Increasingly used for document distribution on the Web and for high-quality printing both locally and remotely. Suffix .pdf 

**Perfect binding** Method of holding together pages of a book without stitching or sewing 

**PostScript** A robust, general purpose page description language which has become the de facto global standard in the prepress industry. Used in almost all imagesetters and many laser printers 

**Print run** The total number of copies produced in one printing 

**Process colours** Colours that can be produced by combining the standard cyan, magenta, yellow and black inks on a printing press 

**Recto** Front/right-hand page 

**Resolution** Refers to the sharpness and clarity of an image. The term is most often used to describe monitors, printers, and bitmapped graphic images. In the case of dot matrix and laser printers, the resolution indicates the number of dpi 

**RGB** Red, green, blue - the **additive** colour model used to represent colour on screen. Colours are reproduced by additive amounts of light passing through a range of pigments 

**RIP** Raster Image Processor. The software/hardware device that interprets output data (such as page description information) to create a bitmapped image comprised of output dots and deliver that image to a print engine 

**Running heads** Copy set at top of printed pages to inform reader of the location in the work. Colloquially known as **running feet** when at the bottom of pages 

**Saddle stitching** Binding by stapling of leaflets and magazines 

**Sans serif** A typeface devoid of serifs, such as Helvetica, Arial 

**Serif** A short, light line projecting from the top or bottom of a main stroke of a letter. Times roman is a serif typeface 

**SGML** Standard Generalized Markup Language, which is the basis for HTML and for all Internet communications. See XML 

**Signature** Sheet of a book as folded ready for printing, ideally 16 pages, but may also be multiples of four 

**Spread** Two facing pages of a publication 

**Style sheets** Used by DTP software to style text globally in documents 

**Style tags** A way to tag or code text, using beginning and ending tags around each block, to enable certain format criteria to be applied. The font, style, size or alignment of the text can be set up 

**Subtractive colour** A term used to describe the primary colours: cyan, magenta, yellow 

**TIFF** Tagged image file format - a common file format for saving and printing bitmapped images. Recommended for storing scans of continuous tone images (at 300 dpi, final reproduction size) and line illustrations (1 200 dpi, final reproduction size). Suffix .tif 

**Typeface** Design or style characteristics of a complete font of type, e.g. Times roman 

**Unjustified** Lines of text either ranged left or right, with the other edge ragged, i.e. with an uneven margin 

**URL** Uniform Resource Locator, i.e. a Web address 

**Vector graphics** A method for representing images, also known as object-oriented graphics. Images are represented as mathematical formulas that define all the shapes in the image. Vector graphics are more flexible than bitmapped graphics because they look the same even when scaled to different sizes. EPS is an example of a vector format

**Verso** Back, left-hand page 

**Widow** Short paragraph-ending line (often one word) appearing at the top of a page or column; to be avoided (see also Orphan) 

**XML** Abbreviation for e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage, a specification developed by the W3C. XML is a pared-down version of SGML, designed especially for Web documents. It allows the creation of customized tags, enabling the definition, transmission, validation and interpretation of data between applications and between organizations.
