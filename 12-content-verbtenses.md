### Consistency

Be consistent in the use of tense. When you begin in the past, stay in the past.

> **The evaluation mission *noted* that the beneficiary schools *had* few teaching materials.**
{: .notice }

A common error is the use of the present perfect to describe an event that has already ended. The correct verb tense for this case is past simple:

> &#10004; **Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate *fell* from 54 percent to 43 percent.**
{: .positive }

> &#10008; not: Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate *has fallen* from 54 percent to 43 percent.
{: .negative }

### The subjunctive

The subjunctive mood expresses a wished-for, hypothetical or contingent relationship between subject and predicate, as for example in "... if I *were* you ..." or "... *be* that as it may ...". It is used after verbs such as "recommend" and "suggest".

> **The Board recommends that WFP *be* proactive in developing partnerships.**
{: .notice }

> **We suggest that he *take* leave of absence until the matter has been resolved.**
{: .notice }

The subjunctive is usually used after "if".

> **If a further emergency *were* to occur during this period.**
{: .notice }

When using the conditional would, be sure to use the subjunctive as well.

> **If funding _were_** [subjunctive] **provided, the project _would_** [conditional] **be able to proceed.**
{: .notice }

> **WFP _would_** [conditional] **have to end its operations if the decision _were_** [subjunctive] **to be negative.**
{: .notice }

### Reported speech

Indirect speech conveys a report of something that was said or written rather than the exact words that were spoken or written. It is used in certain official documents, including summary records. 

**Direct:** The election is being held today.

**Indirect:** The President confirmed that the election was being held that day [or on a specific date].

**Direct:** Fifteen States are members of the working group.

**Indirect:** The Secretary of the Council reported that 15 States were members of the working group.

Even though the original statement may still be valid at the time of reporting, the verb is changed from the present to the past tense since it must agree with the verb in the main clause, which is in the past tense. 

*Note:* This rule is not necessarily applied to statements that are universally true:

The speaker noted that, under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has [*not* had] the right to life, liberty and security of person.

For more information on indirect or reported speech, see the *[United Nations Editorial Manual Online](http://dd.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/ed-guidelines/style/indirect_speech.htm)*.
