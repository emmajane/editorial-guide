Be consistent in the use of tense. When you begin in the past, stay in the past:

> The evaluation mission __noted__ that the beneficiary schools __had__ few teaching materials.
{: .notice }

A common error is the use of the present perfect to describe an event that has already ended. The correct verb tense for this case is past *simple*:

> Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate __fell__ from 54 percent to 43 percent.
{: .positive }

> not: Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate has fallen from 54 percent to 43 percent.
{: .negative }

### The subjunctive
The subjunctive mood expresses a wished-for, hypothetical or contingent relationship between subject and predicate, as for example in "... if I *were* you ..." or "... be *that* as it may ...". It is used after verbs such as "recommend" and "suggest":

__The Board recommends that WFP be proactive in developing partnerships.__

__We suggest that he take leave of absence until the matter has been resolved.__

The subjunctive is usually used after "if":

__If a further emergency were to occur during this period.__

When using the conditional *would*, be sure to use the subjunctive as well:

__If funding were__ [subjunctive] __provided, the project would__ [conditional] __be able to proceed.__

__WFP would__ [conditional] __have to end its operations if the decision were__ [subjunctive] __to be negative.__

## Usage

### Prepositions
In formal writing prepositions should not be placed at the end of a clause or sentence, but there are many circumstances in which a preposition may or even must be so placed, especially to avoid what Sir Winston Churchill called "the kind of English up with which I will not put".

There are no other problems, at least none that the mission is aware of.

The alternative would be: "There are no other problems, at least none of which the mission is aware."

### Its and it's

The word __it's__ is a contraction of __it is__. The apostrophe does not indicate possession.

The word its is a __possessive adjective__; it does not contain an apostrophe.

> Oh, __it's__ [= it is] just the dog wagging __its__ [possessive] tail.
{: .notice }

> Why is today a holiday? __It's__ for the country to celebrate __its__ independence.
{: .notice }

> The country office gives __its__ staff extra security training; __it's__ one of the reasons why people are happy to work here.
{: .notice }

### Like or As

The word introduced by *like* must be a noun or pronoun; it must not be governed by a preposition, but by the subject or object of the main verb.

> __The commodities will be used as a stopgap.__ (The commodities *are* the stopgap.) not: "The commodities will be used like a stopgap."
{: .notice }

> __The document looks like an agenda.__ not: "The document looks like it is an agenda." (The document is not an agenda.)
{: .notice }

Be careful with constructions where like or as could be used:

> __He talks like an expert.__ (He sounds like an expert but may not
be one.)
{: .notice }

> __He is speaking as an expert.__ (He is an expert and is speaking in that capacity.)
{: .notice }

Use such as to give examples.

> __In mountainous countries such as Peru or Nepal ...__
{: .positive }

> Do NOT write "... countries *like* Peru or Nepal...".
{: .negative }

### Singular and Plural

The verb follows the number of the subject, not of the complement:

__A secondary target group__ [subject] __for the project is__ [not are] __the rural communities__ [complement] __in which the very poor primary target group lives.__

Don't be drawn off track by a clause:

__WFP, in addition to the other agencies mentioned, is__ [not are] __looking into the possibility.__

__Exception:__ a subject that is singular in sense though plural in form:

__Twenty miles *is* a long way to walk.__

__Six months *was* the time allowed for completion.__

__Fish and chips *is* is a popular dish.__

Countries that are plural in form take singular verbs:

__The United States *has* the world's most powerful economy.__

A singular verb is used when the group is seen as a unit:

__The team *is* currently based at Brindisi.__

__The staff *consists* entirely of locally employed people.__

A compound subject (with *and*) is normally plural:

__Their lives, their liberties and their religion are__ [not *is*] __in danger.__

When alternative subjects (with *or*) are both singular, the verb is singular:

__United Nations troops have been ordered to shoot if life__ [subject 1] __or property__ [subject 2] __is__ [not *are*] __in danger__.

However, if one subject is singular and one is plural, the verb is plural:

__The registered woman head of household__ [subject 1, singular] __or her children__ [subject 2, plural] __*are* allowed to receive the food ration.__

The plurals __men__ and __women__, not "male" and "female", are used as adjectives when referring to people, e.g. __women farmers__. Use __households headed by women__, NEVER "female-headed households".

The following determiners require a verb in singular:

__Anybody, anyone, somebody, someone, nobody, no one, everybody, everyone; each, every, either, neither; more than one; much, little; one of__ (plural noun but singular verb: one of the projects is ....); __the number of.__

But note that with defining relative clauses introduced by “who” or “that” the verb agrees with the subject of the clause:

__"The unit is one of the teams that are__ (not is) __excluded from the survey".__ “That” refers back to “teams”, not to “one of”, and thus the verb is plural.

The following determiners require a verb in plural:

__a number of, a group of; many, few, both, several; each__ (after a noun or pronoun: "They each play several instruments.").

The following determiners require either singular or plural, depending on the number of the noun:

__a lot; most, some, any, half; none; the majority; percent; that, which, who.__


Certain cases depend on the numerical sense of the sentence, e.g. singular words that refer to groups or plural words that express a singular notion or unit.

With __any/either/neither/none of__, use a singular verb where possible, but a plural verb if the notion of plurality is present: __"None of the suggestions was very interesting"__; but __"None of our problems have been solved" is acceptable.__

### That or Which?
Contrary to common belief, there is a difference between that and which. Using one rather than the other can mean the difference between clarity and confusion.

__*That*__ (restrictive) is defining:

> __The northern regions that are prone to drought are the ones WFP will target.__ (There might be other northern regions, but it is only those that are susceptible to drought that are being targeted for aid.)
{: .notice }

__*Which*__ (non-restrictive) is not defining; it gives additional information that could be omitted and not affect the intended message of the sentence.

> __The northern regions, which are prone to drought, will each receive 450 mt of food.__(Being drought-prone is a characteristic of the northern regions.)
{: .notice }

__*That*__ , as a relative pronoun, is not preceded by a comma; __*which*__ , as a relative pronoun, normally is.

### Possessives
There are three main forms of possessive:

* possessive in ' s (or s' if plural): the project leader's objectives, water users' association;
*􏰀 possessive with of: the objectives of the project leader, association of water users;
* 􏰀 possessive used with gerund to form a noun: as in "He did not approve of his daughter's going to school."

The sense of the possessive can also be conveyed by using an adjective/noun construction: e.g. "office equipment", "project objectives"; the adjective is singular .

> Do not use the's form of possessive with inanimate things: use __"the capacity of the trucks"__, not "the trucks' capacity".
{: .negative }

### Split infinitives
A split infinitive is the separation of the verbal part of an infinitive (e.g. "to understand") from its particle "to". Do not split infinitives: place the adverb before or after the infinitive it modifies or use a structure that avoids a split infinitive. For example:

> &#10004; __WFP intends to develop the project further in the next six months.__
{: .positive }

> &#10008; (not: WFP intends to further develop ...)
{: .negative }


> &#10004; __The document will help the Board to enhance its understanding of the matter..__
{: .positive }

> &#10008; (not: The document will help the Board to better understand)
{: .negative }
