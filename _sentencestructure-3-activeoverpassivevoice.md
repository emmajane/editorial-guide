Choose the active voice over the passive if you can.

> &#10004; WFP responded quickly to decentralization.

> &#10008; not "Decentralization was responded to quickly by WFP."

However, if the writer wishes to be impersonal, perhaps to avoid implications of blame, the passive voice is the better choice.

Take care with word order and subject pronouns. Words placed in the wrong order or the use of subjects such as this or it without a clear referent can lead to ambiguity.

Consider the meaning of this:

> "The woman who shot herself in the foot accidentally recovered".

The line should have read: __The woman who accidentally shot herself in the foot recovered__.

Do not pair two words where one will suffice. It is not necessary to write: "... their *relevance* and *significance* to planning and implementation ..."; the paired terms have the same meaning, so one or the other will suffice.


The meaning is clearer in __"... their relevance to planning and implementation ...".__

The addition of a paired synonym does not strengthen a sentence; it weakens it.
