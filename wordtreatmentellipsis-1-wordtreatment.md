### Capitalization


Use capitals sparingly. Write Member State(s) of WFP, but member state(s)/country(ies) if it's another institution or undefined.

### Job titles

References in text to WFP job titles such as budget officer, project director and accountant are not given as acronyms or capitalized. The following titles are capitalized: Secretary-General, Executive Director, Assistant Executive Director, Regional Director, Country Director, President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Chief, External Auditor, Chief Financial Officer.

### Programmes, conferences, seminars, workshops

Once the full title is given, references to the programme, the conference, etc. are not capitalized.

### Bodies proposed but not yet established

These are not capitalized. The same holds true for references to draft conventions and treaties that do not yet exist.


### Hyphenated phrases
The second word in a hyphenated phrase (and third if there is one) is also capitalized: e.g. Inter-Agency Standing Committee, After-Action Review.

### References to parts of documents
Do not capitalize paragraph, e.g. "In paragraph 12, reference is made to ...". However, Annex is capitalized, e.g. "See Annex IV". Annexes should be numbered in roman capital numerals I, II, III, etc.

### Titles of documents and publications
The titles of __documents__ are set in roman in quotation marks, with capital initial
letters except for articles and prepositions:

__Committee members will need a copy of "Joint Evaluation Report on the Business Process Review" for reference.__

For publications, use capitals for the initial letters except for articles and prepositions, and set the title in *italics*:

__Committee members will need copies of *Eradicating Swine Fever: a Field Manual for Practitioners at the meeting.*__

### Government names

When referring to a government, use a capital letter:

__The French Government ruled that ....__

When referring to more than one government, use a lowercase letter:

__The governments of France and Morocco were asked to comment on the ruling.__

Words such as *committee* and *commission* take a capital letter only when used as part of a proper name. The word *Secretariat* takes a capital letter when referring to WFP.

Do not use acronyms to refer to governments or ministries.

### Italics

Words referred to as words are *italicized*; phrases are set off by quotation marks.

__The word *synergy* is often used incorrectly.__

__The expression "touch and go" has its origin in naval terminology.__

Words quoted from languages other than English are *italicized* and should be followed by a brief explanation in brackets:

__Discussions with beneficiaries were held at the *woreda* (administrative district) level.__

### Ellipsis/dots
When indicating an omission in text, use three ellipses and a space, or four to include the full stop at the end of a sentence.

__Representatives drew attention to the provision "... WFP will ensure that full-cost recovery is applied in operations ... and that partners are so informed ...."__
