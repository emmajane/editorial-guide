The word introduced by *like* must be a noun or pronoun; it must not be governed by a preposition, but by the subject or object of the main verb.

> __The commodities will be used as a stopgap.__ (The commodities *are* the stopgap.) not: "The commodities will be used like a stopgap."

> __The document looks like an agenda.__ not: "The document looks like it is an agenda." (The document is not an agenda.)

Be careful with constructions where like or as could be used:

> __He talks like an expert.__ (He sounds like an expert but may not
be one.)

> __He is speaking as an expert.__ (He is an expert and is speaking in that capacity.)

Use such as to give examples.

> __In mountainous countries such as Peru or Nepal ...__

> Do NOT write "... countries *like* Peru or Nepal...".
