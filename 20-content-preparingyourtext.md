### General points

* All text should be unjustified.
* Make sure that there are no double spaces, particularly between a full stop and a new sentence; one space only is needed.
* Do not use a hard return at the end of lines within a paragraph.
* Switch off automatic hyphenation.
* Headings: use a capital letter for the first word of a heading and for nouns; all other words should be in lower case.
* Ensure that all references in the text also appear in the reference list and vice versa.
* Keep footnotes at the bottom of a page as short as possible.
* Remove all electronic comments from files before submitting for publication. If you have tracked your changes accept all changes before submission.
* Number tables consecutively throughout the publication.
* All abbreviations and symbols should be explained in footnotes to the table.

### Using Excel

Excel is not suitable for the reproduction of graphics for industry-standard printing processes. Excel figures (pie charts, diagrams, etc.) must therefore be converted into EPS files and provided separately from text files.

### Figures

Provide figures as separate files and mark in the text where they should appear. Figures are processed separately from the text, using different software. They should not be embedded in the text file.

### Photos

* High-quality reproductions require high-quality original photographs. Originals should be clear and well-focused, with good contrast.
* Digital images should be saved as CMYK if they are to be reproduced in print. They should be TIFF files to a resolution of 300 dpi.
* Do not embed your photograph within your text file. Images supplied in this way cannot be used.
* Supply a short caption (where required) and a credit for each photograph.
