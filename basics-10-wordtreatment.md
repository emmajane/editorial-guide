### Capitalization


Use capitals sparingly. Write Member State(s) of WFP, but member state(s)/country(ies) if it's another institution or undefined.

### Job titles

References in text to WFP job titles such as budget officer, project director and accountant are not given as acronyms or capitalized. The following titles are capitalized: Secretary-General, Executive Director, Assistant Executive Director, Regional Director, Country Director, President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Chief, External Auditor, Chief Financial Officer.

### Programmes, conferences, seminars, workshops

Once the full title is given, references to the programme, the conference, etc. are not capitalized.

### Bodies proposed but not yet established

These are not capitalized. The same holds true for references to draft conventions and treaties that do not yet exist.


### Hyphenated phrases
The second word in a hyphenated phrase (and third if there is one) is also capitalized: e.g. Inter-Agency Standing Committee, After-Action Review.

### References to parts of documents
Do not capitalize paragraph, e.g. "In paragraph 12, reference is made to ...". However, Annex is capitalized, e.g. "See Annex IV". Annexes should be numbered in roman capital numerals I, II, III, etc.

### Titles of documents and publications
The titles of __documents__ are set in roman in quotation marks, with capital initial
letters except for articles and prepositions:

__Committee members will need a copy of "Joint Evaluation Report on the Business Process Review" for reference.__

For publications, use capitals for the initial letters except for articles and prepositions, and set the title in *italics*:

__Committee members will need copies of *Eradicating Swine Fever: a Field Manual for Practitioners at the meeting.*__

### Government names

When referring to a government, use a capital letter:

__The French Government ruled that ....__

When referring to more than one government, use a lowercase letter:

__The governments of France and Morocco were asked to comment on the ruling.__

Words such as *committee* and *commission* take a capital letter only when used as part of a proper name. The word *Secretariat* takes a capital letter when referring to WFP.

Do not use acronyms to refer to governments or ministries.

### Italics

Words referred to as words are *italicized*; phrases are set off by quotation marks.

__The word *synergy* is often used incorrectly.__

__The expression "touch and go" has its origin in naval terminology.__

Words quoted from languages other than English are *italicized* and should be followed by a brief explanation in brackets:

__Discussions with beneficiaries were held at the *woreda* (administrative district) level.__

### Ellipsis/dots
When indicating an omission in text, use three ellipses and a space, or four to include the full stop at the end of a sentence.

__Representatives drew attention to the provision "... WFP will ensure that full-cost recovery is applied in operations ... and that partners are so informed ...."__


### Spacing

Leave only __one__ letter space after a full stop at the end of a sentence. This rule applies to all punctuation.

### Full stops

Use full stops in contractions such as __e.g.__ and __i.e.__ and in abbreviations such as __M.Sc.__ and __Ph.D.__

* after people's titles, e.g. Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr; spell out Professor;
􏰀* in acronyms, e.g. WFP, DPRK, ODOC;
􏰀* when the last letter of an abbreviated word is the same as that of the
* original word, e.g. Ltd (limited), St (Saint).

### Commas

Use commas to separate elements in a sentence to improve clarity. Avoid overuse of commas.

__When to use a comma__

__To separate clauses__ in a compound sentence, especially when the subject changes in mid-sentence.

> __The Chairman__ [subject 1] __selected the representative of the Netherlands to lead the subcommittee, and the committee__ [subject 2] __agreed.__

When subordinate phrases or clauses are used that are separated by commas from the main part of the sentence, it should always be possible to lift the clauses or phrases out, leaving the rest of the sentence complete.

> __At the start of the year, the crop looked promising.__

> __We feel, whatever others may think, that the project is a good one.__

__Between adjectives.__ Use a comma between adjectives that give similar kinds
of information.

> __It was a well-planned, effective project.__

__When not to Use a Comma__

In lists, omit the comma before the *and* (or before the (*or*) preceding the last item.

> __The rations included corn-soya blend (CSB), rice, oil and salt.__

> __Food-for-work activities take place on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.__

Exception:

Use a comma if the penultimate item also contains an "and" or is necessary to avoid ambiguity.

> __The workshop covered orientation, monitoring and evaluation, and feedback.__

### Colons
A colon is generally followed by a lowercase letter and is usually used to introduce a list or a definition.

__The programme materials will include: the agenda, a handbook, work sheets, etc.__

However, an initial capital letter is used when a colon is followed by a complete sentence:

__The committee posed the following questions: What are the constraints on development? What will be the benefits?__

A colon is used to separate one clause from a second clause that contains an illustration, explanation or amplification of the first:

__The delivery of rations was interrupted for two days: roads and bridges had been washed away in the rains and subsequent flooding.__

### Semicolons

Semicolons are used to mark independent clauses in a sentence. Information in the second clause is added to that in the first; it does not explain or amplify (see "Colons" above).

__The delivery of rations was interrupted for two days; alternative means of transport had to be found to resume the shipments.__


__The water was as smooth as glass; the further bank was perfectly reflected in it.__ (Semicolon – the second clause adds related information to the first.)

__The water was as smooth as glass: not a breath of wind was stirring.__ (Colon – the second clause explains the first.)

Admire:

__"It is the fate of those who toil at the lower employments of life to be rather driven by the fear of evil than attracted by the prospect of good; to be exposed to censure without hope of praise; to be disgraced by miscarriage or punished for neglect where success would have been without applause and diligence without reward. "__ (Samuel Johnson, 1755)

Semicolons may be used to separate items in a list that are sentences or clauses (and that could be a bulleted list):

__The project achieved the following: i) it reached 160,000 beneficiaries; ii) its costs were within the estimated budget; and iii) it provided experience for future interventions.__

Semicolons separate the entries of a numbered or bulleted list:

* assess needs;
* train workers; and
* monitor progress.

### Hyphens

There is a distinction between a hyphen and an en-dash (–). Apart from the difference in length, there is a difference in purpose.

Follow the *Oxford Concise English Dictionary* or the WFP frequently used word list.

The hyphen is designed to link two words to form a compound, usually an adjective. “Capacity-building” is always hyphenated.

__When to Use a Hyphen__

The hyphen is designed to link two words to form a compound, usually an adjective. “Capacity-building” is always hyphenated.

__Adjectives.__ The hyphen is used to form a compound adjective out of two linked words modifying a noun: "long term", "grass roots", "civil society", "private sector", “food for work” when used as adjectives before the noun they qualify become "a long-term programme", "grass-roots support", "civil-society organizations", "private-sector involvement", “food-for-work activities”.

__Adverbs.__ With adverbs, no hyphen is needed, particularly with adverbs ending in -ly. But one is needed when the adverb might be mistaken for an adjective. For example, a "little, used car" is not the same as a "little-used car".

__Pendent hyphens.__ "... two-, three- or four-year periods" is technically the correct form. But avoid the construction where possible; "periods of two, three or four years" is clearer.

__When not to Use a Hyphen__

The tendency in English is not to hyphenate compound nouns or prefixes where the sense is clear, as for example in subeditor, overuse, database, germplasm, proofreader.

Do not hyphenate adjectives modified by adverbs such as "locally purchased food" or "environmentally sound development".

### En-dashes

An en-dash is used to connect spans of numbers or dates (e.g. 2005–2006) and where the second word in a group does not modify the first one, as in "a WFP– FAO project". It is also used to separate an interjected phrase from the main sentence, in which case it is used with a space before and after it. As with commas, it should be possible to lift out the part of the sentence within dashes, leaving the rest of the sentence complete.

__This donation – the largest received so far – will enable WFP to buy extra food.__

### Parentheses, or brackets

(When a complete sentence is enclosed in parentheses, its punctuation is also enclosed.)

When only part of a sentence is enclosed in parentheses, punctuation is placed outside (as in this example).

Avoid parentheses/brackets wherever possible. Sentences are much clearer without them.

(Use square brackets [if needed] within parentheses.)

### Quotation marks

Double quotation marks are used for quoting sentences, phrases or words.

As with parentheses, punctuation marks are placed inside the quotation marks only if they belong to the quotation; otherwise they are placed outside. When a full stop or other punctuation mark would apply both to the quotation and the sentence, it’s placed outside the quotation marks.

Reported speech is enclosed in double quotation marks.

Where one quotation appears within another, the inner quotation takes single quotes:

__"When we say 'urgent', we mean the day before yesterday," said the editor.__

Punctuation not referring to the quote itself falls outside the quotation marks:

__Mr Smith was said to be "resigned to his fate".__

However, where a complete sentence is quoted, it takes its own punctuation:

__Mr Smith was said to be "resigned to his fate in the restructuring. He did not expect miracles."__

When a quotation is interrupted by words such as she said, commas separate the interjected phrase:

__"We will do it by Friday," she said, "so the deadline will be respected."__
