### Templates
Where available, use WFP templates and formats (such as those found in the Programme Guidance Manual (PGM) or at WFPgo/coms/templates.

For WFP publications follow the branding guidance available at [http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools](http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools).

### Formatting
The formatting of original documents should be as simple as possible: documents for the Board, the Bureau and consultations are formatted in the Document Processing Unit (DPU), where special templates are used. If graphics are to be included, the original electronic files should accompany any document that is to be formatted so that they can be inserted.

### Text that cannot be changed
If a document going to editing contains text that cannot be changed, for example because it has been agreed with other parties, please make sure that it is clearly indicated.

### Fonts
Use Times New Roman 12 point for Board documents.


Use __*italic*__ exclusively for book titles and for words and expressions in languages other than English (which must be explained in brackets):

Use *bold* for sub-headings, but not where text is highlighted by the formatting, for example in bulleted lists.
