### WFP templates

Where available, use WFP templates and formats such as those found in the Programme Guidance Manual (PGM) or at [http://go.wfp.org/web/communications/templates](http://go.wfp.org/web/communications/templates).

For WFP publications follow the branding guidance available at [http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools](http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools).

### Formatting documents for the Executive Board

The formatting of original documents should be as simple as possible: documents for the Board, the Bureau and consultations are formatted in the Document Processing Unit (DPU), where special templates are used. If graphics are to be included, the original electronic files should accompany any document that is to be formatted so that they can be inserted.

### Text that cannot be changed

If a document going to editing contains text that cannot be changed, for example because it has been agreed with other parties, please make sure that it is clearly indicated.

### Font use for Executive Board Documents

Use Times New Roman 12 point for Board documents.

For outreach documents in particular see WFP branding guidance: [http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools](http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools).

Use **_italic_** exclusively for book titles and for words and expressions in languages other than English (which must be explained in brackets).

Use **bold** for sub-headings, but not where text is highlighted by the formatting, for example in bulleted lists.

Avoid overuse of italic and bold lettering. Do not use italic or bold fonts in text to denote emphasis, which should be reflected in the phrasing.


### Your document after editing

If your document is edited for the Board, it will be returned to you for clearance with two copies attached. One copy shows all of the editor’s deletions and insertions, and is a read-only document. The second copy has incorporated the editor’s changes, with doubts or queries marked in yellow; it is open for you to amend if required. Any blue highlighting is for internal formatting use.

You will be asked to review the document to ensure that editorial changes did not alter the meaning of the original or remove essential text. You should enter any changes into the OPEN FOR REVISIONS copy in track changes mode.

Remember that Board documents must adhere to word limits set by the Board.
