Be consistent. When you use a bulleted or numbered list, make sure the items all follow the same structure - complete sentences or verb phrases or noun phrases. For example:

The project is characterized by the following features:

* It will provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources.
* It is expected to be self-financing through user fees.
* All stakeholders will participate in all aspects of system management.

OR __verb phrases__ (each bullet point begins with a verb):

The project is characterized by features that will:

* provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* self-finance the system through user fees; and
* allow all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.

Do not create lists that use all three features, as in:

The project is characterized by the following features:

* provision [noun] of a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* the system is expected to be self-financing [complete sentence] through user fees; and
* allows [verb] all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.
