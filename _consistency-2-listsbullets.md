A bullet list should:

* introduce the list with a colon;
* use initial lowercase letters;
* end each with a semicolon;
* put and after the penultimate semicolon; and
* close the final entry with a full stop.

When entries consist of complete sentences, begin each with a capital letter and end each with a full stop.

Lists are not punctuated if the entries are very short:

* radios
* televisions
* cameras

If a list consists of __names of countries__, make sure they are in __alphabetical order__. The rule does not apply if it is clear the countries are listed in a different order for a reason (for example, from largest operation to smallest)
