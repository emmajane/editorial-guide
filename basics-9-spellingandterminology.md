### British Spelling

Ensure that the default language for your document is set to __English (UK)__. Note that some WFP terminology differs from this standard.


### Place Names

For names of countries, adjectives of nationality and denominations of currency, consult the FAOTERM Names of Countries.

In text, list countries in alphabetical order, except when the order in which they appear serves the discussion, for example when listing countries in descending order of malnutrition rates.


### Z versus S

Use __z__ (not s) in such words as reali__z__e, organi__z__ation and mobili__z__ation.

Use __s__ in words such as analy__s__e, cataly__s__e, and paraly__s__e.

If in doubt, follow the first spelling given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Follow an organizationâ€™s spelling of its own name, e.g. Organi__s__ation for Economic Co-__o__peration and Development.
