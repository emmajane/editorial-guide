There are three main forms of possessive:

* possessive in ' s (or s' if plural): the project leader's objectives, water users' association;
*􏰀 possessive with of: the objectives of the project leader, association of water users;
* 􏰀 possessive used with gerund to form a noun: as in "He did not approve of his daughter's going to school."

The sense of the possessive can also be conveyed by using an adjective/noun construction: e.g. "office equipment", "project objectives"; the adjective is singular .

> Do not use the's form of possessive with inanimate things: use __"the capacity of the trucks"__, not "the trucks' capacity".
