A bullet list should:
* introduce the list with a colon;
* use initial lowercase letters;
* end each with a semicolon;
* put and after the penultimate semicolon; and
* close the final entry with a full stop.

When entries consist of complete sentences, begin each with a capital letter and end each with a full stop.

Bullet lists are not punctuated if the entries are very short:
* radios
* televisions
* cameras

**Be consistent.** Make sure the items all follow the same structure - complete sentences or verb phrases or noun phrases. For example:

**Complete sentences:**

The project is characterized by the following features:
* It will provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources.
* It is expected to be self-financing through user fees.
* All stakeholders will participate in all aspects of system management.

OR **verb phrases** (each bullet point begins with a verb):

The project is characterized by features that will:
* provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* self-finance the system through user fees; and
* allow all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.

OR **noun phrases** (each bullet point begins with a noun):

The project is characterized by the following features:
* provision of a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* self-financing of the system through user fees; and
* participation of all stakeholders in all aspects of system management.

**Do not** create lists that use all three features, as in:

The project is characterized by the following features:
* provision [noun] of a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* the system is expected to be self-financing [complete sentence] through user fees; and
* allows [verb] all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.
