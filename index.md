The World Food Programme’s [Branding Guidance](http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/communications_content/documents/communications/wfp211867.pdf) (PDF, 4.7MB) was published in 2009 and has now been effectively implemented across our organization, strengthening our brand image through consistent representation.

Building on this initiative, the World Food Programme’s _User Interface Style Guide_ emphasizes WFP’s commitment and potential to establish and build our brand.

Defined to help create, in an easy way, consistent and attractive user interfaces for WFP's properties, the guidelines contained in this guide are to be applied to all WFP digital products (such as: websites, web applications, internal systems and other).

The Guide is a living document created to meet the needs of WFP's front-end developers and designers. If there is a _Component_ or _Pattern_ that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us via [wfp.publications@wfp.org](mailto:WFP.PUBLICATIONS@wfp.org?subject=UI%20Style%20Guide).
