### British Spelling

Ensure that the default language for your document is set to **English (UK)**. Note that some WFP terminology differs from this standard.

### Z versus S

Use **z** (not s) in such words as reali**z**e, organi**z**ation and mobili**z**ation.

Use **s** in words such as analy**s**e, cataly**s**e, and paraly**s**e.

If in doubt, follow the first spelling given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Follow an organization’s spelling of its own name, e.g. Organi**s**ation for Economic Co-**o**peration and Development.

### Country names

For names of countries, adjectives of nationality and denominations of currency, consult the FAOTERM Names of Countries.

Note these official “short names” of countries: the Niger, State of Palestine, the Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, the United Republic of Tanzania (listed under “U”), Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (listed under “V”).

In text, list countries in alphabetical order, except when the order in which they appear serves the discussion, for example when listing countries in descending order of malnutrition rates.
