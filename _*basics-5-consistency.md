### Complete Sentences

Be consistent. When you use a bulleted or numbered list, make sure the items all follow the same structure - complete sentences or verb phrases or noun phrases. For example:

The project is characterized by the following features:

* It will provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources.
* It is expected to be self-financing through user fees.
* All stakeholders will participate in all aspects of system management.

OR __verb phrases__ (each bullet point begins with a verb):

The project is characterized by features that will:

* provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* self-finance the system through user fees; and
* allow all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.

Do not create lists that use all three features, as in:

The project is characterized by the following features:

* provision [noun] of a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* the system is expected to be self-financing [complete sentence] through user fees; and
* allows [verb] all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.

### Lists/Bullets

A bullet list should:

* introduce the list with a colon;
* use initial lowercase letters;
* end each with a semicolon;
* put and after the penultimate semicolon; and
* close the final entry with a full stop.

When entries consist of complete sentences, begin each with a capital letter and end each with a full stop.

Lists are not punctuated if the entries are very short:

* radios
* televisions
* cameras

If a list consists of __names of countries__, make sure they are in __alphabetical order__. The rule does not apply if it is clear the countries are listed in a different order for a reason (for example, from largest operation to smallest).


### Verb Tense

Be consistent in the use of tense. When you begin in the past, stay in the past:

> The evaluation mission __noted__ that the beneficiary schools __had__ few teaching materials.
{: .notice }

A common error is the use of the present perfect to describe an event that has already ended. The correct verb tense for this case is past *simple*:

> Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate __fell__ from 54 percent to 43 percent.
{: .positive }

> not: Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate has fallen from 54 percent to 43 percent.
{: .negative }

#### The subjunctive
The subjunctive mood expresses a wished-for, hypothetical or contingent relationship between subject and predicate, as for example in "... if I *were* you ..." or "... be *that* as it may ...". It is used after verbs such as "recommend" and "suggest":

__The Board recommends that WFP be proactive in developing partnerships.__

__We suggest that he take leave of absence until the matter has been resolved.__

The subjunctive is usually used after "if":

__If a further emergency were to occur during this period.__

When using the conditional *would*, be sure to use the subjunctive as well:

__If funding were__ [subjunctive] __provided, the project would__ [conditional] __be able to proceed.__

__WFP would__ [conditional] __have to end its operations if the decision were__ [subjunctive] __to be negative.__
