Contrary to common belief, there is a difference between that and which. Using one rather than the other can mean the difference between clarity and confusion.

__*That*__ (restrictive) is defining:

> __The northern regions that are prone to drought are the ones WFP will target.__ (There might be other northern regions, but it is only those that are susceptible to drought that are being targeted for aid.)

__*Which*__ (non-restrictive) is not defining; it gives additional information that could be omitted and not affect the intended message of the sentence.

> __The northern regions, which are prone to drought, will each receive 450 mt of food.__(Being drought-prone is a characteristic of the northern regions.)

__*That*__ , as a relative pronoun, is not preceded by a comma; __*which*__ , as a relative pronoun, normally is.
