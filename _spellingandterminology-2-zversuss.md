Use __z__ (not s) in such words as reali__z__e, organi__z__ation and mobili__z__ation.

Use __s__ in words such as analy__s__e, cataly__s__e, and paraly__s__e.

If in doubt, follow the first spelling given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Follow an organizationâ€™s spelling of its own name, e.g. Organi__s__ation for Economic Co-__o__peration and Development.
