notes: I was not able to replicate the blockquotes directly from the full guide as the blockquotes already is in italics and usage of both italics and bold is used to emphasis and denote contrast in the guide itself. Maybe we could do use colour or position a tick beside it.
notes-2: Hierarchy isn't very clear, e.g. "Word treatment; ellipsis" has a header which contains, in the table of contents, "Word treatment" and "Capitalization" as on the same level, however in the actual content "Capitalization" appears to be a sub header of "Word treatment". I have put "Word treatment" and "Capitalization" under the same heading, but "Word treatment" is effectively empty. "Punctuation" is treated as a top level header but in the actual content treated the same as "Word treatment". "Lists/bullets" is in its own header within the TOC, below details but in the content it is contained within consistency. Ordered list in (numbers and units > general, place names > geographical terms), it is roman numerals (might need to use list-style-type)
notes-3: "some, approximately, more than, over, as in "... targeting approximately 600,000 beneficiaries ...". Unnecessary.", "compared with" needs word spacing
