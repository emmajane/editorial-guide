### Prepositions

In formal writing prepositions should not be placed at the end of a clause or sentence, but there are many circumstances in which a preposition may or even must be so placed, especially to avoid what Sir Winston Churchill called "the kind of English up with which I will not put".

It is perfectly acceptable to write:

**There are no other problems, at least none that the mission is aware of.**

The alternative would be: "There are no other problems, at least none of which the mission is aware."

### Its and it's

The word **_it's_** is a contraction of **_it is_**. The apostrophe does not indicate possession.

The word **_its_** is a **possessive adjective**; it does not contain an apostrophe.

> Oh, **it's** [= it is] just the dog wagging **its** [possessive] tail.
{: .notice }

> Why is today a holiday? **It's** for the country to celebrate **its** independence.
{: .notice }

> The country office gives **its** staff extra security training; **it's** one of the reasons why people are happy to work here.
{: .notice }

### Like or as

The word introduced by *like* must be a noun or pronoun; it must not be governed by a preposition, but by the subject or object of the main verb.

> __The commodities will be used as a stopgap.__ (The commodities *are* the stopgap.) not: "The commodities will be used like a stopgap."
{: .notice }

> __The document looks like an agenda.__ not: "The document looks like it is an agenda." (The document is not an agenda.)
{: .notice }

Be careful with constructions where *like* or *as* could be used:

> __He talks like an expert.__ (He sounds like an expert but may not be one.)
{: .notice }

> __He is speaking as an expert.__ (He is an expert and is speaking in that capacity.)
{: .notice }

Use **_such_** as to give examples.

> __In mountainous countries such as Peru or Nepal ...__ Do NOT write "... countries *like* Peru or Nepal...".
{: .notice }


### Single and plural

The verb follows the number of the subject, not of the complement.

> **A secondary target group** [subject] **for the project _is_** [not *are*] **the rural communities** [complement] **in which the very poor primary target group lives.**
{: .notice }

Do not be drawn off track by a clause.

> **WFP, in addition to the other agencies mentioned, _is_** [not *are*] **looking into the possibility.**
{: .notice }

**Exception:** a subject that is singular in sense though plural in form.

> **Twenty miles *is* a long way to walk.**
{: .notice }

> **Six months *was* the time allowed for completion.**
{: .notice }

> **Fish and chips *is* is a popular dish.**
{: .notice }

Countries that are plural in form take singular verbs.

> **The United States *has* the world's most powerful economy.**
{: .notice }

A singular verb is used when the group is seen as a unit.

> **The team *is* currently based at Brindisi.**
{: .notice }

> **The staff *consists* entirely of locally employed people.**
{: .notice }

A compound subject (with *and*) is normally plural.

> **Their lives, their liberties and their religion _are_** [not *is*] **in danger.**
{: .notice }

When alternative subjects (with *or*) are both singular, the verb is singular.

> **United Nations troops have been ordered to shoot if life** [subject 1] **or property** [subject 2] **_is_** [not *are*] **in danger.**
{: .notice }

However, if one subject is singular and one is plural, the verb is plural:

> **The registered woman head of household** [subject 1, singular] **or her children** [subject 2, plural] **_are_ allowed to receive the food ration.**
{: .notice }

The plurals **men** and **women**, not "male" and "female", are used as adjectives when referring to people, e.g. **women farmers**. Use **households headed by women**, NEVER "female-headed households".

**_Determiners_**

The following determiners require a verb in singular:

**Anybody, anyone, somebody, someone, nobody, no one, everybody, everyone; each, every, either, neither; more than one; much, little; one of** (plural noun but singular verb: one of the projects is ....)**; the number of.**

But note that with defining relative clauses introduced by "who" or "that" the verb agrees with the subject of the clause:

__"The unit is one of the teams that are__ (not is) __excluded from the survey".__

"That" refers back to "teams", not to "one of", and thus the verb is plural.

The following determiners require a verb in plural:

__a number of, a group of; many, few, both, several; each__ (after a noun or pronoun: "They each play several instruments.").

The following determiners require either singular or plural, depending on the number of the noun:

__a lot; most, some, any, half; none; the majority; percent; that, which, who.__

Certain cases depend on the numerical sense of the sentence, e.g. singular words that refer to groups or plural words that express a singular notion or unit.

With __any/either/neither/none of__, use a singular verb where possible, but a plural verb if the notion of plurality is present: __"None of the suggestions was very interesting"__; but __"None of our problems have been solved" is acceptable.__

### That or which?

Contrary to common belief, there is a difference between *that* and *which*. Using one rather than the other can mean the difference between clarity and confusion.

__*That*__ (restrictive) is defining:.

> __The northern regions that are prone to drought are the ones WFP will target.__ (There might be other northern regions, but it is only those that are susceptible to drought that are being targeted for aid.)
{: .notice }

__*Which*__ (non-restrictive) is not defining; it gives additional information that could be omitted and not affect the intended message of the sentence.

> __The northern regions, which are prone to drought, will each receive 450 mt of food.__(Being drought-prone is a characteristic of the northern regions.)
{: .notice }

__*That*__ , as a relative pronoun, is not preceded by a comma; __*which*__, as a relative pronoun, normally is.


### Possessives

There are three main forms of possessive:

* possessive in *'s* (or *s'* if plural): the project leader's objectives, water users' association;
* possessive with *of*: the objectives of the project leader, association of water users;
* possessive used with gerund to form a noun: as in "He did not approve of his daughter's going to school."

The sense of the possessive can also be conveyed by using an adjective/noun construction: e.g. "office equipment", "project objectives"; the adjective is singular .

Do not use the *'s* form of possessive with inanimate things: use __"the capacity of the trucks"__, not "the trucks' capacity".


### Split infinitives

A split infinitive is the separation of the verbal part of an infinitive (e.g. "to understand") from its particle "to". Do not split infinitives: place the adverb before or after the infinitive it modifies or use a structure that avoids a split infinitive. For example:

> &#10004; __WFP intends to develop the project further in the next six months.__
{: .positive }

> &#10008; (not: WFP intends to further develop ...)
{: .negative }

> &#10004; __The document will help the Board to enhance its understanding of the matter..__
{: .positive }

> &#10008; (not: The document will help the Board to better understand)
{: .negative }
