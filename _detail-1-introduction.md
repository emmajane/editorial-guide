Include only relevant detail needed to make your point. Too much information will weaken or obscure your argument.

Consider these two sentences, which say the same thing:

(i) "Food rations, including the planned quantities of fortified food commodities such as corn-soya blend (CSB) and high-energy biscuits (HEB), grain-based food items such as wheat flour, barley and rice, pulses such as beans and lentils, sugar, locally baked bread products including loaves, rolls, small pastries and traditional cakes, vegetable oil such as regionally procured olive oil and locally- produced oil pressed from sunflower seeds, and iodized and non-iodized salt were distributed fully, equitably and in a timely manner by WFP field and country office staff assisted by locally employed workers, both women and men, staff of partner and non-partner non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government counterpart staff and personnel representing selected implementing partners (IPs), to the full caseload of all refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other specific beneficiary groups, with due attention to specially targeted vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women, children under 5, disabled people, women heads of households, chronically sick or elderly people and people suffering from or affected by HIV/AIDS, and in line with the objectives of the protracted relief and recovery operation (PRRO) as agreed with government representatives from ministries such as the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Food Supply and the Ministry for the Coordination of Health, Social Welfare and Food Supply." (204 words)

(ii) "Rations were distributed." (3 words)

Sentence (i) contains all possible detail, so anything of significance is obscured in the mass of information;

Sentence (ii) contains no detail at all, so nothing of significance is conveyed to the reader.

Neither sentence makes a clear point.
