In English, the usual sentence structure is subject, followed by verb, followed by object or complement. Keep the verb and object close to the subject. For example:

> &#10004; __If current trends continue, by the turn of the century tourism__ [subject] __will displace__ [verb] __agriculture__ [object] __as the island's main industry.__

> &#10008; not: Tourism, if current trends continue, by the turn of the century will displace agriculture as the island's main industry.

Don't appear to change subject in mid-sentence; for example, prepositional phrases should be adjacent to the noun they refer to:

> &#10004; With its numerous beaches, the island offers good prospects for tourism.

> &#10008; not: With its with numerous beaches, tourism has good prospects in the island.
