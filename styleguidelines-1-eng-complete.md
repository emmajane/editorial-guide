notes: I was not able to replicate the blockquotes directly from the full guide as the blockquotes already is in italics and usage of both italics and bold is used to emphasis and denote contrast in the guide itself. Maybe we could do use colour or position a tick beside it.

### <a name="audience">Audience</a>
This WFP Style Guide is intended as a resource for authors writing in English and for authors who want their documents to conform to WFP style.

The aim is to help authors to produce clear, consistent, readable texts that are accessible to an audience that varies enormously in terms of language and culture. The guide sets out the style conventions used in WFP and advises on usage. Preferred word forms and spellings, acronyms and country names may be found INSERT LINKS.

__Multi-cultural communication__

Writers should bear in mind that many of those who read documents in English are not mother-tongue users of English. Many documents have to be translated into the other official languages – Arabic, French and Spanish – and often Russian, Chinese and Portuguese.

Adjust the discourse to intended readers. Do not assume they have technical knowledge. Avoid jargon (see "things to avoid"). Be clear and concise. Present ideas in a logical sequence.

Aim for clarity, accuracy, continuity and consistency.

### Basics

#### Templates
Where available, use WFP templates and formats (such as those found in the Programme Guidance Manual (PGM) or at WFPgo/coms/templates.

For WFP publications follow the branding guidance available at [http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools](http://go.wfp.org/web/wfpgo/publishingtools).

#### Formatting
The formatting of original documents should be as simple as possible: documents for the Board, the Bureau and consultations are formatted in the Document Processing Unit (DPU), where special templates are used. If graphics are to be included, the original electronic files should accompany any document that is to be formatted so that they can be inserted.

#### Text that cannot be changed
If a document going to editing contains text that cannot be changed, for example because it has been agreed with other parties, please make sure that it is clearly indicated.

#### Fonts
Use Times New Roman 12 point for Board documents.


Use __*italic*__ exclusively for book titles and for words and expressions in languages other than English (which must be explained in brackets):

Use *bold* for sub-headings, but not where text is highlighted by the formatting, for example in bulleted lists.

#### Tools of the trade

* the latest edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary or the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (available online);
* WFP English Style Guidelines;
* List of Acronyms;
* WFP organizational chart; and
* UNTERM.

### <a name="sentence-structure">Sentence structure</a>

#### Subject/Verb/Object
In English, the usual sentence structure is subject, followed by verb, followed by object or complement. Keep the verb and object close to the subject. For example:

&#10004; __If current trends continue, by the turn of the century tourism__ [subject] __will displace__ [verb] __agriculture__ [object] __as the island's main industry.__

&#10008; not: Tourism, if current trends continue, by the turn of the century will displace agriculture as the island's main industry.

Don't appear to change subject in mid-sentence; for example, prepositional phrases should be adjacent to the noun they refer to:

&#10004; With its numerous beaches, the island offers good prospects for tourism.

&#10008; not: With its with numerous beaches, tourism has good prospects in the island.

#### Long Sentences
Avoid long complicated sentences. Short, clear sentences convey meaning more effectively than a single complex structure.

### Active Over Passive Voice

Choose the active voice over the passive if you can.

&#10004; WFP responded quickly to decentralization.

&#10008; not "Decentralization was responded to quickly by WFP."

However, if the writer wishes to be impersonal, perhaps to avoid implications of blame, the passive voice is the better choice.

Take care with word order and subject pronouns. Words placed in the wrong order or the use of subjects such as this or it without a clear referent can lead to ambiguity.

Consider the meaning of this:

> "The woman who shot herself in the foot accidentally recovered".

The line should have read: __The woman who accidentally shot herself in the foot recovered__.

Do not pair two words where one will suffice. It is not necessary to write: "... their *relevance* and *significance* to planning and implementation ..."; the paired terms have the same meaning, so one or the other will suffice.


The meaning is clearer in __"... their relevance to planning and implementation ...".__

The addition of a paired synonym does not strengthen a sentence; it weakens it.

### Consistency
Be consistent. When you use a bulleted or numbered list, make sure the items all follow the same structure - complete sentences or verb phrases or noun phrases. For example:

#### Complete sentences:
The project is characterized by the following features:

* It will provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources.
* It is expected to be self-financing through user fees.
* All stakeholders will participate in all aspects of system management.

OR __verb phrases__ (each bullet point begins with a verb):

The project is characterized by features that will:

* provide a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* self-finance the system through user fees; and
* allow all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.

Do not create lists that use all three features, as in:

The project is characterized by the following features:

* provision [noun] of a system of management and monitoring that will ensure sustainable use of the region's natural resources;
* the system is expected to be self-financing [complete sentence] through user fees; and
* allows [verb] all stakeholders to participate in all aspects of system management.

### Lists/bullets

A bullet list should:

* introduce the list with a colon;
* use initial lowercase letters;
* end each with a semicolon;
* put and after the penultimate semicolon; and
* close the final entry with a full stop.

When entries consist of complete sentences, begin each with a capital letter and end each with a full stop.

Lists are not punctuated if the entries are very short:

* radios
* televisions
* cameras

If a list consists of __names of countries__, make sure they are in __alphabetical order__. The rule does not apply if it is clear the countries are listed in a different order for a reason (for example, from largest operation to smallest)

## Verb tense

### Verb tense

Be consistent in the use of tense. When you begin in the past, stay in the past:

> The evaluation mission __noted__ that the beneficiary schools __had__ few teaching materials.

A common error is the use of the present perfect to describe an event that has already ended. The correct verb tense for this case is past *simple*:

> Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate __fell__ from 54 percent to 43 percent.

> not: Between 2003 and 2005, the enrolment rate has fallen from 54 percent to 43 percent.

### The subjunctive
The subjunctive mood expresses a wished-for, hypothetical or contingent relationship between subject and predicate, as for example in "... if I *were* you ..." or "... be *that* as it may ...". It is used after verbs such as "recommend" and "suggest":

__The Board recommends that WFP be proactive in developing partnerships.__

__We suggest that he take leave of absence until the matter has been resolved.__

The subjunctive is usually used after "if":

__If a further emergency were to occur during this period.__

When using the conditional *would*, be sure to use the subjunctive as well:

__If funding were__ [subjunctive] __provided, the project would__ [conditional] __be able to proceed.__

__WFP would__ [conditional] __have to end its operations if the decision were__ [subjunctive] __to be negative.__

## Usage

### Prepositions
In formal writing prepositions should not be placed at the end of a clause or sentence, but there are many circumstances in which a preposition may or even must be so placed, especially to avoid what Sir Winston Churchill called "the kind of English up with which I will not put".

There are no other problems, at least none that the mission is aware of.

The alternative would be: "There are no other problems, at least none of which the mission is aware."

### Its and it's

The word __it's__ is a contraction of __it is__. The apostrophe does not indicate possession.

The word its is a __possessive adjective__; it does not contain an apostrophe.

> Oh, __it's__ [= it is] just the dog wagging __its__ [possessive] tail.

> Why is today a holiday? __It's__ for the country to celebrate __its__ independence.

> The country office gives __its__ staff extra security training; __it's__ one of the reasons why people are happy to work here.

### Like or As

The word introduced by *like* must be a noun or pronoun; it must not be governed by a preposition, but by the subject or object of the main verb.

> __The commodities will be used as a stopgap.__ (The commodities *are* the stopgap.) not: "The commodities will be used like a stopgap."

> __The document looks like an agenda.__ not: "The document looks like it is an agenda." (The document is not an agenda.)

Be careful with constructions where like or as could be used:

> __He talks like an expert.__ (He sounds like an expert but may not
be one.)

> __He is speaking as an expert.__ (He is an expert and is speaking in that capacity.)

Use such as to give examples.

> __In mountainous countries such as Peru or Nepal ...__

> Do NOT write "... countries *like* Peru or Nepal...".

### Singular and Plural

The verb follows the number of the subject, not of the complement:

__A secondary target group__ [subject] __for the project is__ [not are] __the rural communities__ [complement] __in which the very poor primary target group lives.__

Don't be drawn off track by a clause:

__WFP, in addition to the other agencies mentioned, is__ [not are] __looking into the possibility.__

__Exception:__ a subject that is singular in sense though plural in form:

__Twenty miles *is* a long way to walk.__

__Six months *was* the time allowed for completion.__

__Fish and chips *is* is a popular dish.__

Countries that are plural in form take singular verbs:

__The United States *has* the world's most powerful economy.__

A singular verb is used when the group is seen as a unit:

__The team *is* currently based at Brindisi.__

__The staff *consists* entirely of locally employed people.__

A compound subject (with *and*) is normally plural:

__Their lives, their liberties and their religion are__ [not *is*] __in danger.__

When alternative subjects (with *or*) are both singular, the verb is singular:
