A split infinitive is the separation of the verbal part of an infinitive (e.g. "to understand") from its particle "to". Do not split infinitives: place the adverb before or after the infinitive it modifies or use a structure that avoids a split infinitive. For example:

> &#10004; __WFP intends to develop the project further in the next six months.__

> &#10008; (not: WFP intends to further develop ...)


> &#10004; __The document will help the Board to enhance its understanding of the matter..__

> &#10008; (not: The document will help the Board to better understand)
