### Prepositions

In formal writing prepositions should not be placed at the end of a clause or sentence, but there are many circumstances in which a preposition may or even must be so placed, especially to avoid what Sir Winston Churchill called "the kind of English up with which I will not put".

There are no other problems, at least none that the mission is aware of.

The alternative would be: "There are no other problems, at least none of which the mission is aware."

### Its and it's

The word __it's__ is a contraction of __it is__. The apostrophe does not indicate possession.

The word its is a __possessive adjective__; it does not contain an apostrophe.

> Oh, __it's__ [= it is] just the dog wagging __its__ [possessive] tail.

> Why is today a holiday? __It's__ for the country to celebrate __its__ independence.

> The country office gives __its__ staff extra security training; __it's__ one of the reasons why people are happy to work here.

### Like or As

The word introduced by *like* must be a noun or pronoun; it must not be governed by a preposition, but by the subject or object of the main verb.

> __The commodities will be used as a stopgap.__ (The commodities *are* the stopgap.) not: "The commodities will be used like a stopgap."

> __The document looks like an agenda.__ not: "The document looks like it is an agenda." (The document is not an agenda.)

Be careful with constructions where like or as could be used:

> __He talks like an expert.__ (He sounds like an expert but may not
be one.)

> __He is speaking as an expert.__ (He is an expert and is speaking in that capacity.)

Use such as to give examples.

> __In mountainous countries such as Peru or Nepal ...__

> Do NOT write "... countries *like* Peru or Nepal...".

### Single and Plural

The verb follows the number of the subject, not of the complement:

__A secondary target group__ [subject] __for the project is__ [not are] __the rural communities__ [complement] __in which the very poor primary target group lives.__

Don't be drawn off track by a clause:

__WFP, in addition to the other agencies mentioned, is__ [not are] __looking into the possibility.__

__Exception:__ a subject that is singular in sense though plural in form:

__Twenty miles *is* a long way to walk.__

__Six months *was* the time allowed for completion.__

__Fish and chips *is* is a popular dish.__

Countries that are plural in form take singular verbs:

__The United States *has* the world's most powerful economy.__

A singular verb is used when the group is seen as a unit:

__The team *is* currently based at Brindisi.__

__The staff *consists* entirely of locally employed people.__

A compound subject (with *and*) is normally plural:

__Their lives, their liberties and their religion are__ [not *is*] __in danger.__

When alternative subjects (with *or*) are both singular, the verb is singular:

__United Nations troops have been ordered to shoot if life__ [subject 1] __or property__ [subject 2] __is__ [not *are*] __in danger__.

However, if one subject is singular and one is plural, the verb is plural:

__The registered woman head of household__ [subject 1, singular] __or her children__ [subject 2, plural] __*are* allowed to receive the food ration.__

The plurals __men__ and __women__, not "male" and "female", are used as adjectives when referring to people, e.g. __women farmers__. Use __households headed by women__, NEVER "female-headed households".

The following determiners require a verb in singular:

__Anybody, anyone, somebody, someone, nobody, no one, everybody, everyone; each, every, either, neither; more than one; much, little; one of__ (plural noun but singular verb: one of the projects is ....); __the number of.__

But note that with defining relative clauses introduced by “who” or “that” the verb agrees with the subject of the clause:

__"The unit is one of the teams that are__ (not is) __excluded from the survey".__ “That” refers back to “teams”, not to “one of”, and thus the verb is plural.

The following determiners require a verb in plural:

__a number of, a group of; many, few, both, several; each__ (after a noun or pronoun: "They each play several instruments.").

The following determiners require either singular or plural, depending on the number of the noun:

__a lot; most, some, any, half; none; the majority; percent; that, which, who.__


Certain cases depend on the numerical sense of the sentence, e.g. singular words that refer to groups or plural words that express a singular notion or unit.

With __any/either/neither/none of__, use a singular verb where possible, but a plural verb if the notion of plurality is present: __"None of the suggestions was very interesting"__; but __"None of our problems have been solved" is acceptable.__

### That or Which?

Contrary to common belief, there is a difference between that and which. Using one rather than the other can mean the difference between clarity and confusion.

__*That*__ (restrictive) is defining:

> __The northern regions that are prone to drought are the ones WFP will target.__ (There might be other northern regions, but it is only those that are susceptible to drought that are being targeted for aid.)

__*Which*__ (non-restrictive) is not defining; it gives additional information that could be omitted and not affect the intended message of the sentence.

> __The northern regions, which are prone to drought, will each receive 450 mt of food.__(Being drought-prone is a characteristic of the northern regions.)

__*That*__ , as a relative pronoun, is not preceded by a comma; __*which*__ , as a relative pronoun, normally is.


### Possessives

There are three main forms of possessive:

* possessive in ' s (or s' if plural): the project leader's objectives, water users' association;
*􏰀 possessive with of: the objectives of the project leader, association of water users;
* 􏰀 possessive used with gerund to form a noun: as in "He did not approve of his daughter's going to school."

The sense of the possessive can also be conveyed by using an adjective/noun construction: e.g. "office equipment", "project objectives"; the adjective is singular .

> Do not use the's form of possessive with inanimate things: use __"the capacity of the trucks"__, not "the trucks' capacity".


### Split Infinitives

A split infinitive is the separation of the verbal part of an infinitive (e.g. "to understand") from its particle "to". Do not split infinitives: place the adverb before or after the infinitive it modifies or use a structure that avoids a split infinitive. For example:

> &#10004; __WFP intends to develop the project further in the next six months.__

> &#10008; (not: WFP intends to further develop ...)


> &#10004; __The document will help the Board to enhance its understanding of the matter..__

> &#10008; (not: The document will help the Board to better understand)


### Officialise

Avoid jargon, buzzwords and buzz phrases. They obscure meaning and make documents more difficult to understand and to translate.

__Redundant words and words to avoid__

Avoid unnecessary adjectives and adverbs: they add to the length of a document and usually impede communication.

Some examples of words and expressions to avoid:


__key.__ A *key* decision is an important or significant decision; *key* personnel are essential staff. In most cases there is no need to use a qualifier at all.

_strategic.__ "Strategic" can be used to mean "affecting WFP as a whole", but do not write expressions such as "...a *strategic* policy decision...", because a decision on policy is by its nature strategic.

__due to, owing to.__ Use "because of", "caused by" or "resulting from

__above-mentioned.__ Leave out.

__activities.__ Leave out. __not__ "training *activities*", "school feeding *activities*", "advocacy *activities*" or "emergency response *activities*".

__a total of.__ Leave out. __not__ "The operation cost WFP *a total of* USD 743,200 ..."__; not__ "WFP will require a *total* of 45 trucks ...".

__better; further,__ as in "... to *better* understand..." or "... to *further* develop ...". Use "... to enhance understanding of ...", or "... to continue development of ...". Split infinitives such as the ones quoted should in any case be avoided.

__both ... and.__ "And" by itself is sufficient.

__brief(ly),__ especially with "summary". A summary is an abbreviation of a text, so "briefly" is redundant.

__careful(ly).__ Leave out. __not__ "...the rations are __carefully__ calculated on the basis of...". (They would not be calculated carelessly.)

__closely.__ To say that "WFP will work *closely* with its partners" or "... is collaborating *closely* with ..." implies that there are circumstances in which WFP could work "distantly" with them.

__concrete.__ Unnecessary. __not__ "... the department has made *concrete* proposals for developing ...".

__corporate-wide,__ as in"...a *corporate-wide* policy decision...". Any decision on policy will by its nature affect the whole organization -- and WFP is not a corporation.

__detailed (analysis)__. An analysis must by nature pay attention to detail.

__duly__, as in "... *duly* authorized ..." or "... *duly* signed ...". Unnecessary.

__effective(ly)__, as in " ... proposals for *effective* strategies to address the problem ...". Avoid. Nobody is going to propose ineffective strategies; in any case, effectiveness is determined after the event.

__efforts__, as in "... WFP will continue its advocacy *efforts* for ...". Unnecessary.

__events__, as in "... is affected by recurrent flood *events* ...". Unnecessary.

__food commodity.__ Do not use *commodity* as a synonym for "food". Use "food item(s)" if you need to specify, just as "non-food item(s)" is used. The OED defines a commodity as "... a thing that is an object of trade, *esp*. a raw material or agricultural crop".

__furthermore, in addition, moreover, similarly.__ Usually redundant.

__including,__ as in "... all beneficiaries, *including* women and children ...". Unnecessary.

__mutual (agreement).__ An agreement is by definition mutual.

__necessary,__ as in "... ensure that staff have the *necessary* skills to...". *Un*necessary.

__respective(ly)__, as in "... will report to their *respective* departments ...". Avoid constructions such as "... rose by 2.5 percent and 3.6 percent in 2004 and 2005 *respectively* ...". Use "... rose by 2.5 percent in 2004 and by 3.6 percent in 2005 ...".

__some, approximately, more than, over__, as in "... targeting approximately 600,000 beneficiaries ...". Unnecessary.


__specific,__ as in "... must give *specific* reasons ..." or "... in the *specific* event of an emergency ...". Unnecessary.

__to the extent possible__, as in "... WFP will support the project to the *extent possible* ...". If you have to qualify, be precise, as in "as long as resources are available ..." or "provided access is granted ...".

__Generic + specific__

Do not use a generic term followed by examples, or an example followed by a generic term, as in "... natural disasters (flood, drought, earthquake etc.) ..." or "... in a fire or other emergency ...".

Some examples of words to avoid:


__including,__ as in "... vulnerable refugees, *including* women and children ...".

__namely__, as in "... the project will require a *number of inputs, namely* additional project staff, more training activities for partner staff and increased space in the existing offices ...".

__Metaphors__

Metaphors are unlikely to convey meaning to non-native speakers of English and are not readily translatable.

Some examples of metaphors and other words/expressions to avoid:

__bolster.__ Prefer "supported", "increased", "enhanced", etc.

__bundling.__ Prefer "combining".

__dashboard__. In corporatespeak it means "a set of" or perhaps "a system of".

__framework__. Use "office", "structure", "organization", "system", "process", "plan", "table", "project", as appropriate. Exception: United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF).

__methodology__. Prefer "methods". 

__prior__ to. Use "before".

__role__, as in "... WFP will play the role of facilitator ..." or "... in this operation, the role of WFP will be to ...". Prefer "WFP is to be the facilitator" or "WFP will ...".

__strengthen__. Prefer "enhance", "improve", "increase" etc. as applicable. For example "... to increase coverage ...", "... to improve understanding ...", "... to enhance its nutritive value ...".

__talk the talk/walk the walk.__ Difficult to translate.

__traffic lights__. The term means "a system to identify different states or situations"; prefer "monitoring system" or "early-warning plan" or whatever accurately conveys your meaning.

__window__, as in "window of opportunity". Commonly misused.

__*Expressions in Latin and other languages*__

| AVOID | USE |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| __ad hoc__ (= for this purpose)       |        as required |
| __e.g.__ *(exemplum gratis)*      |        for example; or instance |
| __i.e.__ *(id est)*       |        that is; in other words |
| __inter alia__       |        among other things (it's almost always redundant) |
| __modus operandi__       |        way of working; method of implementation |
| __post-__       |        after; subsequent |
| __vis- &agrave;-vi s       |        with regard to; regarding |

__Miscellaneous__

__As, since, because__ and __for__. *As* and *since* are used when the reason is already well known or is less important than the rest of the sentence; they often begin the sentence. Use *because* to avoid possible confusion with the notion of time. *Because* is generally used when the reason is the most important part of the sentence. Use it rather than as or since. *For* suggests that the reason is given as an afterthought, and its clause never comes at the beginning of the sentence. Avoid it.

__As well as.__ *As well* as means and not only; it does not mean and additionally; therefore the phrase that follows must be the most important or basic element: "The programme will accomplish A and B as well as [i.e. and not only] C." It is not a solution for adding a last item after a penultimate item containing the word *and*. Use it sparingly; *and* is usually sufficient.

__Association, group, organization.__ Don’t alternate these terms for the same entities; choose whichever is appropriate and stick to it.

__Biennial, bi-annual.__ *Biennial* clearly means "once in a biennium" or "once every two years". But DO not use the ambiguous *bi-annual*: it can be taken to mean either "twice a year" or "once every two years".

__Bi-monthly, bi-weekly.__ DO not use these ambiguous terms: bi-monthly can mean either "twice a month" or "once every two months". The same applies to bi-weekly.

__Between or among.__ Between can only be used with two factors. When you have three or more factors, use among.

__Compared with__ or __compared to__. Use *compared with* when comparing *like* things: "When compared with last year’s yield, this year’s harvest shows a 10-percent increase." Use compared to when comparing *unlike* things: “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” (Shakespeare).

__Concerned__. Putting *concerned* before the noun risks conveying the sense that the parties etc. are worried. The preferable placement is after – *the parties concerned, the countries concerned* – because the meaning is "the parties that are concerned".

__False intensifiers__. Do not use *very, particularly, extremely*, etc. with words such as *critical, crucial, decisive, fundamental, unique or usual.* Something either is crucial, unique, etc. or it is not; there’s no degree and therefore no need for intensifiers. In general, avoid intensifiers: they are subjective terms that dilute meaning.

__Fewer__ or __less__. Use *fewer* only when referring to items that are *countable*: "There are fewer people here today than there were yesterday." *Less* is used for *uncountable* quantities: "He has put less effort into this job."


__Level__. Use *the* before an adjective qualifying *level*, as in "At *the* national level", not "at national level".

__Male/Female.__ Use *men* and *women* as adjectives when referring to people, not male and female (exception: male or female members of a family or household): “household headed by women” (not “female-headed household”).

__Mobilize__. Does not mean *animate, encourage or stimulate*. It means "organize for service or action", "render movable", "bring into circulation".

__Nouns in apposition.__ The treatment depends on whether the item cited is the only one of its kind: "My sister, Barbara, has arrived" (commas before and after the noun in apposition; implies you only have one sister) or "My sister Barbara has arrived" (no commas; implies you have several sisters and the one called Barbara has arrived).

- - -
__Prepositions__. Avoid common mistakes in the use of prepositions by following these general rules:

* __assist in + gerund__ (e.g. “assist in planning”; not “assist to plan”)
* __help + infinitive__ (e.g. “help to develop”)
* __integrate into__ (not in)
* __suggest + gerund__ (e.g. “suggest using”; not “suggest to use”)
* __to target - no preposition__ (e.g. "... will target children under 5 ..."); but NB "... targeted to children under 5 ..."

__Such as, including.__ *Such as* or *including* implies that you’re listing only some of the items, so there’s no need to add etc. at the end.

__Synergy.__ *Synergy* means: “i) the interaction or cooperation of two or more drugs, agents, organizations, etc.,*to produce a new or enhanced effect compared with their separate effects;* ii) an instance of this”. Don’t use *synergistic* as a synonym for "cooperative", "interconnected" or "interrelated".
