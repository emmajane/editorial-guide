### General

Numbers from one to ten are written in text as words. The numbers 11 upwards are written as numerals. Exceptions to this are:

i.	A number that begins a sentence is always written out as a word, e.g. Fifteen NGOs were present.
ii.	A number accompanying a unit is always written as a numeral, e.g. km, 8 percent, USD 2 million.
iii. A number used as a person's age is written as a numeral, e.g. children under 5, the 6–10 age group.
iv.	If numbers from both groups are used together, numerals are used, e.g. "... 5 skilled and 27 unskilled workers participated ...".

In regular text, use commas to denote thousands: e.g. 100,000 or 51,357. Write numbers in millions as a numeral, with one decimal place if necessary, followed by a hard space and the word million – e.g. 2.6 million mt.

In tables, thousands and millions are denoted by a hard space – e.g. 6 234 859.

For telephone and fax numbers, be consistent in the use of hyphens, parentheses and spaces.

### Qualifiers - avoid them

Do not qualify numbers with "some", "over", "more than" "less than" or "approximately". If it is important to give an exact number, do so; otherwise use the formats set out here. Hence:

**"... the operation requires 4,000 mt of food ..."** not "... the operation requires some 4,000 mt of food ..."
**"... targeting 600,000 refugees ..."** not "... targeting more than 600,000 refugees ..."

It is obvious that the numbers are approximations.

### Fractions

Write fractions in words. Fractions are not hyphenated: two thirds; four fifths. They are hyphenated, however, when used as compound adjectives, e.g. "a two-thirds share".

### Units of measure

The standard abbreviations for metric units of measure are used, for example **m** for metres, **km** for kilometres, **ha** for hectares, **g** for grams, **mt** for metric tons (do not use "tonnes"). Square kilometres is written as **km**<sup>**2**</sup> and cubic metres as **m**<sup>**3**</sup> , lower case/superscript and preceded by a non-breaking space.

These abbreviations are not spelled out.

If the use of local units of measurement cannot be avoided, provide the equivalent in units that are easily understood by the reader.

Do not use punctuation with such measurements (e.g. 1 cm, 6 km, 5 g, 10 ha).

Do not abbreviate the word litre.

### Percent

Use **percent** (not per cent or %) in text. The use of % is acceptable only in tables and graphs. When using the percentage sign in a table, do not use a space (e.g. 16%, not 16 %).

### Currency

For internal documents, use the abbreviations **USD** for United States dollars and **EUR** for Euros.

In text, one decimal place is preferred for all amounts in millions.

> **Food-for-work activities totalled USD 23.2 million.**
{: .notice }

Two decimal places are preferred for all amounts in billions.

> **The programme of work is expected to total 4.21 billion.**
{: .notice }

There will be exceptions to this in financial documents, in which amounts are given in full: e.g. USD 23,231,059.

In text, amounts under 1 million are written in hundreds of thousands (without decimal places) rather than using the million unit measure.

> **USD 873,300 will finance technical assistance and special studies.** (not USD 0.873 million.)
{: .notice }

For any public facing material US$ should be used to denote currency in US dollars whereas for WFP internal and EB documents  this should be written as USD.   

### Dates

WFP uses the international day/month/year format for dates (e.g. Monday 3 July 2006). Note that there is no comma between the month and the year and no "th" or "rd" after the date numeral.

Write a period covering a number of days as follows:
**from 10 to 20 July 1997** OR **10–20 July 1997**
**from 15 October to 1 November** OR **15 October – 1 November**

Do not mix them.

**_Crop, fiscal or school years_**

Use a slash (/) between years to indicate a period beginning in one calendar year and ending in another – e.g. "...the 2003/04 school year..." Calendar years. Use an en-dash (--) between years to indicate calendar years. Thus 1995–1999 would cover the five-year period including both 1995 and 1999.

**_Centuries_**

Write out centuries in full (e.g. “twentieth century).

**_Decades_**

Decades should be written using numerals. For example, "In the 1990s ...". Do not use an apostrophe (not "the 1990's").

### Time

The 24-hour system is used: 11.00 (not 11 a.m.); 17.45 (not 5.45 p.m.) Do not use the word hours: e.g. "13:00" (not "13:00 hours").
