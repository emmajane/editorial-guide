Writers should bear in mind that many of those who read documents in English are not mother-tongue users of English. Many documents have to be translated into the other official languages – Arabic, French and Spanish – and often Russian, Chinese and Portuguese.

Adjust the discourse to intended readers. Do not assume they have technical knowledge. Avoid jargon (see "things to avoid"). Be clear and concise. Present ideas in a logical sequence.

Aim for clarity, accuracy, continuity and consistency.
