### Spacing

Leave only **one** letter space after a full stop at the end of a sentence. This rule applies to all punctuation.

### Full stops

Use full stops in contractions such as **e.g.** and **i.e.** and in abbreviations such as **M.Sc.** and **Ph.D.**

Do not use full stops:
* after people's titles, e.g. Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr; spell out Professor;
* in acronyms, e.g. WFP, DPRK, ODOC;
* when the last letter of an abbreviated word is the same as that of the original word, e.g. Ltd (limited), St (Saint).

### Commas

Use commas to separate elements in a sentence to improve clarity. Avoid overuse of commas.

**_When to use a comma_**

**To separate clauses** in a compound sentence, especially when the subject changes in mid-sentence.

> **The Chairman** [subject 1] **selected the representative of the Netherlands to lead the subcommittee, and the committee** [subject 2] **agreed.**
{: .notice }

When subordinate phrases or clauses are used that are separated by commas from the main part of the sentence, it should always be possible to lift the clauses or phrases out, leaving the rest of the sentence complete.

> **At the start of the year, the crop looked promising.**
{: .notice }

> **We feel, whatever others may think, that the project is a good one.**
{: .notice }

**Between adjectives.** Use a comma between adjectives that give similar kinds of information.

> *It was a well-planned, effective project.**
{: .notice }

**_When not to use a comma_**

In lists, omit the comma before the *and* (or before the *or*) preceding the last item.

> **The rations included corn-soya blend (CSB), rice, oil and salt.**
{: .notice }

> **Food-for-work activities take place on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.**
{: .notice }

Exception:

Use a comma if the penultimate item also contains an "and" or is necessary to avoid ambiguity.

> **The workshop covered orientation, monitoring and evaluation, and feedback.**
{: .notice }

### Colons

A colon is generally followed by a lowercase letter and is usually used to introduce a list or a definition.

> **The programme materials will include: the agenda, a handbook, work sheets, etc.**
{: .notice }

However, an initial capital letter is used when a colon is followed by a complete sentence:

> **The committee posed the following questions: What are the constraints on development? What will be the benefits?**
{: .notice }

A colon is used to separate one clause from a second clause that contains an illustration, explanation or amplification of the first:

> **The delivery of rations was interrupted for two days: roads and bridges had been washed away in the rains and subsequent flooding.**
{: .notice }

### Semicolons

Semicolons are used to mark independent clauses in a sentence. Information in the second clause is added to that in the first; it does not explain or amplify (see "Colons" above).

> **The delivery of rations was interrupted for two days; alternative means of transport had to be found to resume the shipments.**
{: .notice }

Compare:

**The water was as smooth as glass; the further bank was perfectly reflected in it.** (Semicolon – the second clause adds related information to the first.)
  
**The water was as smooth as glass: not a breath of wind was stirring.** (Colon – the second clause explains the first.)

Semicolons may be used to separate items in a list that are sentences or clauses (and that could be a bulleted list).

> **The project achieved the following: i) it reached 160,000 beneficiaries; ii) its costs were within the estimated budget; and iii) it provided experience for future interventions.**
{: .notice }

Semicolons separate the entries of a numbered or bulleted list:
* assess needs;
* train workers; and
* monitor progress.

### Hyphens

There is a distinction between a hyphen and an en-dash (--). Apart from the difference in length, there is a difference in purpose.

Follow the *[Concise Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concise_Oxford_English_Dictionary)* or the WFP frequently used word list.

**_When to use a hyphen_**

The hyphen is designed to link two words to form a compound, usually an adjective. “Capacity-building” is always hyphenated.

**Adjectives**. The hyphen is used to form a compound adjective out of two linked words modifying a noun: "long term", "grass roots", "civil society", "private sector", “food for work” when used as adjectives before the noun they qualify become "a long-term programme", "grass-roots support", "civil-society organizations", "private-sector involvement", “food-for-work activities”.

**Adverbs**. With adverbs, no hyphen is needed, particularly with adverbs ending in -ly. But one is needed when the adverb might be mistaken for an adjective. For example, a "little, used car" is not the same as a "little-used car".

**Pendent hyphens.** "... two-, three- or four-year periods" is technically the correct form. But avoid the construction where possible; "periods of two, three or four years" is clearer.

**_When not to use a hyphen_**

The tendency in English is not to hyphenate compound nouns or prefixes where the sense is clear, as for example in subeditor, overuse, database, germplasm, proofreader.

Do not hyphenate adjectives modified by adverbs such as "locally purchased food" or "environmentally sound development" (note the –ly ending).

**_Hyphenated phrases_**

The second word in a hyphenated phrase (and third if there is one) is also capitalized: e.g. Inter-Agency Standing Committee, After-Action Review.

### En-dashes

An en-dash is used to connect spans of numbers or dates (e.g. 2005--2006) and where the second word in a group does not modify the first one, as in "a WFP--FAO project". It is also used to separate an interjected phrase from the main sentence, in which case it is used with a space before and after it. As with commas, it should be possible to lift out the part of the sentence within dashes, leaving the rest of the sentence complete.

> **This donation –- the largest received so far -– will enable WFP to buy extra food.**
{: .notice }

### Parentheses, or brackets

(When a complete sentence is enclosed in parentheses, its punctuation is also enclosed.)

When only part of a sentence is enclosed in parentheses, punctuation is placed outside (as in this example).

Avoid parentheses/brackets wherever possible. Sentences are much clearer without them.

(Use square brackets [if needed] within parentheses.)

### Quotation marks

Double quotation marks are used for quoting sentences, phrases or words.

As with parentheses, punctuation marks are placed inside the quotation marks only if they belong to the quotation; otherwise they are placed outside. When a full stop or other punctuation mark would apply both to the quotation and the sentence, it’s placed outside the quotation marks.

Reported speech is enclosed in double quotation marks.

Where one quotation appears within another, the inner quotation takes single quotes.

> **"When we say 'urgent', we mean the day before yesterday," said the editor.**
{: .notice }

Punctuation not referring to the quote itself falls outside the quotation marks.

> **Mr Smith was said to be "resigned to his fate".**
{: .notice }

However, where a complete sentence is quoted, it takes its own punctuation.

> **Mr Smith was said to be "resigned to his fate in the restructuring. He did not expect miracles."**
{: .notice }

When a quotation is interrupted by words such as she said, commas separate the interjected phrase.

> **"We will do it by Friday," she said, "so the deadline will be respected."**
{: .notice }
