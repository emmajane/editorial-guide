### Non-English Words

If necessary, briefly explain local terms in a footnote when they're first mentioned, for example "walo<sup>1</sup> (<sup>1</sup>low-lying land flooded during part of the year)", "woreda (administrative district)".

Some __Greek and Latin__ words have passed into common usage in English – but be careful with the plural forms:

* phenomenon/phenomena;
* criterion/criteria;
* 􏰃genus/genera;
* 􏰃datum (rare in the singular)/data; 􏰃 forum/fora;
* 􏰃medium/media.

__Avoid Latin and Greek expressions__ – use the English equivalents.

For example, use "among other things", not *inter alia*. If you are determined to use a Latin or Greek expression, check the *Shorter* or the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary:* some have passed into common usage and are set in roman (ad hoc), while others are italicized and may be transliterated (*intuitu personae, hoi polloi*).
