__Published sources__

All references must include: i) books – name of author(s) in bold, year of publication, title, place of publication and publisher; if the place of publication is a national capital, there is no need to include the name of the country; ii) articles – author, article title (in normal roman font), journal title (italic), volume (issue no. in brackets) and pages.

Give the names of all the authors of a work. When an author has written more than one work in the same year, use a, b, etc. to differentiate, e.g. 1996a, 1996b.

Use the ampersand (&) between the names of the last two authors in the bibliography but use and in the text.

Titles of books and journals are italicized. Titles of articles and chapters are set in roman. The principal words are capitalized.
