Use Times New Roman 12 point for Board documents.


Use __*italic*__ exclusively for book titles and for words and expressions in languages other than English (which must be explained in brackets):

Use *bold* for sub-headings, but not where text is highlighted by the formatting, for example in bulleted lists.
