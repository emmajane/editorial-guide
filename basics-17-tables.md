Number tables in sequence. Each table should have a title that describes it accurately and briefly.

Material that would be better off in two separate tables such as data that, although related, are organized differently and have different column headings should not be put in a single table to save space.

Data adequately treated in the text or in a figure should not be repeated in tabular form.

Similarly, there is no need to create a table if it would consist of only one column or row of data; such data should be described in the text, as in the following example:

__The increases in recent years were 10.9 percent in 2003, 10.1 percent in 2004 and 9.7 percent in 2005.__

A table must be placed immediately after the paragraph in which it is mentioned.
The staff of the Document Processing Unit are available for any technical assistance required with the creation or layout of tables.
