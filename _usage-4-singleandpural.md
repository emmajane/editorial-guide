The verb follows the number of the subject, not of the complement:

__A secondary target group__ [subject] __for the project is__ [not are] __the rural communities__ [complement] __in which the very poor primary target group lives.__

Don't be drawn off track by a clause:

__WFP, in addition to the other agencies mentioned, is__ [not are] __looking into the possibility.__

__Exception:__ a subject that is singular in sense though plural in form:

__Twenty miles *is* a long way to walk.__

__Six months *was* the time allowed for completion.__

__Fish and chips *is* is a popular dish.__

Countries that are plural in form take singular verbs:

__The United States *has* the world's most powerful economy.__

A singular verb is used when the group is seen as a unit:

__The team *is* currently based at Brindisi.__

__The staff *consists* entirely of locally employed people.__

A compound subject (with *and*) is normally plural:

__Their lives, their liberties and their religion are__ [not *is*] __in danger.__

When alternative subjects (with *or*) are both singular, the verb is singular:

__United Nations troops have been ordered to shoot if life__ [subject 1] __or property__ [subject 2] __is__ [not *are*] __in danger__.

However, if one subject is singular and one is plural, the verb is plural:

__The registered woman head of household__ [subject 1, singular] __or her children__ [subject 2, plural] __*are* allowed to receive the food ration.__

The plurals __men__ and __women__, not "male" and "female", are used as adjectives when referring to people, e.g. __women farmers__. Use __households headed by women__, NEVER "female-headed households".

The following determiners require a verb in singular:

__Anybody, anyone, somebody, someone, nobody, no one, everybody, everyone; each, every, either, neither; more than one; much, little; one of__ (plural noun but singular verb: one of the projects is ....); __the number of.__

But note that with defining relative clauses introduced by “who” or “that” the verb agrees with the subject of the clause:

__"The unit is one of the teams that are__ (not is) __excluded from the survey".__ “That” refers back to “teams”, not to “one of”, and thus the verb is plural.

The following determiners require a verb in plural:

__a number of, a group of; many, few, both, several; each__ (after a noun or pronoun: "They each play several instruments.").

The following determiners require either singular or plural, depending on the number of the noun:

__a lot; most, some, any, half; none; the majority; percent; that, which, who.__


Certain cases depend on the numerical sense of the sentence, e.g. singular words that refer to groups or plural words that express a singular notion or unit.

With __any/either/neither/none of__, use a singular verb where possible, but a plural verb if the notion of plurality is present: __"None of the suggestions was very interesting"__; but __"None of our problems have been solved" is acceptable.__
