### Subject/Verb/Object

In English, the usual sentence structure is subject, followed by verb, followed by object or complement. Keep the verb and object close to the subject. For example:

> &#10004; __If current trends continue, by the turn of the century tourism__ [subject] __will displace__ [verb] __agriculture__ [object] __as the island's main industry.__

> &#10008; not: Tourism, if current trends continue, by the turn of the century will displace agriculture as the island's main industry.

Don't appear to change subject in mid-sentence; for example, prepositional phrases should be adjacent to the noun they refer to:

> &#10004; With its numerous beaches, the island offers good prospects for tourism.

> &#10008; not: With its with numerous beaches, tourism has good prospects in the island.

### Long Sentences

Avoid long complicated sentences. Short, clear sentences convey meaning more effectively than a single complex structure.


### Active Over Passive Voice


Choose the active voice over the passive if you can.

> &#10004; WFP responded quickly to decentralization.

> &#10008; not "Decentralization was responded to quickly by WFP."

However, if the writer wishes to be impersonal, perhaps to avoid implications of blame, the passive voice is the better choice.

Take care with word order and subject pronouns. Words placed in the wrong order or the use of subjects such as this or it without a clear referent can lead to ambiguity.

Consider the meaning of this:

> "The woman who shot herself in the foot accidentally recovered".

The line should have read: __The woman who accidentally shot herself in the foot recovered__.

Do not pair two words where one will suffice. It is not necessary to write: "... their *relevance* and *significance* to planning and implementation ..."; the paired terms have the same meaning, so one or the other will suffice.


The meaning is clearer in __"... their relevance to planning and implementation ...".__

The addition of a paired synonym does not strengthen a sentence; it weakens it.
