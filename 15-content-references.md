### Footnotes
Footnotes should be brief, limited to providing references or extra information that would be out of context in the body of the text.

The accepted footnote style for published references is:

__Smith, J. & Brown, J.B. 2001. *The School Feeding Handbook.* New York, HarperCollins.__

__Smith, J. 1999. Feeding Children. *Journal of Nutrition* 8(6): 22â€“23.__

Note that articles are set in normal roman font. The titles of books and book-
length documents such as manuals and handbooks are *italicized*.

__Footnote numbering__

Footnote numbers should be in superscript and attached to the word(s) or phrase to which they refer, for example:

__The programme__<sup>__7__</sup> __will run from ....__

If the word(s) or phrase is followed by punctuation, the footnote number is placed after the punctuation mark, for example:


__... at the end of the programme,__<sup>7</sup> __when ...__


__... at the end of the programme,__<sup>7</sup> __when ...__
