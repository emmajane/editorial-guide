### Footnotes

Footnotes should be brief, limited to providing references or extra information that would be out of context in the body of the text.

**_Accepted footnote styles_**

For published references:

> __Smith, J. & Brown, J.B. 2001. *The School Feeding Handbook.* New York, HarperCollins.__

> __Smith, J. 1999. Feeding Children. *Journal of Nutrition* 8(6): 22â€“23.__

Note that articles are set in normal roman font. The titles of books and book-length documents such as manuals and handbooks are *italicized*.

For Board documents:

> "Food Aid for All" (WFP/EB.1/2007/5-A).

For non-Board documents:

> **WFP.** 2007. *Fundraising: Challenges and Opportunities.* Internal report, unpublished.

> **Pietersen, K.P.** 2007. *World Hunger - a Statistical Analysis.* Ph.D. thesis, unpublished.

> **Compton, D.C.S.** 2007. *Hybrid Crops for Food Production.* London, forthcoming.

**_Footnote numbering_**

Footnote numbers should be in superscript and attached to the word(s) or phrase to which they refer, for example:

__The programme__<sup>__7__</sup> __will run from ....__

If the word(s) or phrase is followed by punctuation, the footnote number is placed after the punctuation mark, for example:

__... at the end of the programme,__<sup>7</sup> __when ...__

__... at the end of the programme,__<sup>7</sup> __when ...__
